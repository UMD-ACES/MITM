# Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) SSH Server

## Objective

Provide students with the ability to collect SSH related data (login attempts, keystrokes) without the need to build their own SSH server.

## Expectations

This program as is should only facilitate students with the collection of SSH related data.

This program is not meant to facilitate the following:
* Honeypot Architecture Setup
* Recycling
* Monitoring
* Data Analysis

However, students may modify this program as they wish to add or change desired functionality.

# Data Collection
This program will collect 3 main types of data:
1. Authentication attempts - including client IP, username, and password
2. Successful logins - client IP
3. Session stream - raw session stream between the client & SSH server
4. Session keystrokes - all the individual keystrokes and the parsed lines

## Start the MITM server

Run `node mitm.js -n <container name> -i <container internal IP> -p <MITM listening port>` to start the MITM server.

Run with the `--debug` flag for verbose debug output. This is helpful when first setting up the server.

## Configuration

Run with the `--help` option to see full list of configurable options and defaults.

## Automatic Access

This feature allows an attacker to successfully authenticate after a certain number of login attempts.

Auto-access will only be available for 1 automatic access per MITM process, meaning that once MITM is triggered once, it will be disabled.

Furthermore, enabling auto-access will essentially disable authentication checks against the SSH server itself until auto-access strategy triggers.

Enable auto-access by toggling the `--auto-access` option, then you must configure one of the two strategies available:
1. normal distribution
2. fixed attempt

For normal distribution strategy, the server will allow auto-access after `--auto-access-normal-distribution-mean` number of attempts with the consideration of `--auto-access-normal-distribution-std-dev` to randomize the number of attempts required.

For fixed attempt strategy, the server will simply allow auto-access after `--auto-access-fixed` number of attempts.

**Important Note:** The container makes the ultimate decision. The container's `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file has the ability to deny login credentials even though they may be valid (e.g. `DenyUsers root` or `PermitRootLogin no`)

## Port Redirection

If you use `iptables` to redirect SSH traffic to the MITM server and you redirect it to `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`), you may need to enable the following system option:
```
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1
```
(depending on your system, this configuration may not persist past a reboot)

## Running MITM in the background

Please check this [wiki page](https://github.com/UMD-ACES/MITM/wiki/Running-in-the-Background) if you would like to run the MITM in the background

## Stay up to date
Run `git pull origin main` inside the /root/MITM directory.
